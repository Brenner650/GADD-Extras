# GADD-Extras
For all your signage and extra object needs.


Follow the instructions in the files found inside "Map content"
If you wish to add more files to this pbo, just create new files inside "Mapcontent" then call to it in the fn_init.sqf 
Instructions are in there too. If you do not call to it in the init of the pbo, it wont run.

All you have to do is modify the files you want, add all your shit to the files, call them in the provided fn_init.sqf inside the init folder
If you didnt add any new files, ignore the init.

Enjoy.
